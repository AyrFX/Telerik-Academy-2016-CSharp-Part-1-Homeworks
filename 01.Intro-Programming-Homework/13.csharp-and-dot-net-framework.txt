C# and .NET Differences

C# is a multi-paradigm programming language encompassing strong typing, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented
(class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines. It’s one of the programming languages designed for the Common Language
Infrastructure (CLI).
.NET Framework is a software framework developed by Microsoft that runs primarily on Microsoft Windows. It includes a large class
library known as Framework Class Library (FCL) and provides language interoperability (each language can use code written in other
languages) across several programming languages. Programs written for .NET Framework execute in a software environment, known as Common
Language Runtime (CLR), an application virtual machine that provides services such as security, memory management, and exception handling.
FCL and CLR together constitute .NET Framework.
